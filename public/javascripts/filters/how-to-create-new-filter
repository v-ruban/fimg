for creating new filter:
1) create new file in the filters folder;
2) create constructor for this filter in this file;
3) aggregate base filter in the new filter;
4) extend new filter prototype with base filter functions;
5) override compute function (if you need), and getPixelValue;
6) add new filter to the filter controller (look at the 12 line);
7) add new filter to the worker file (look at the 1 and 28 line).
